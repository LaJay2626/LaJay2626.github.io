          Janet Jackson, yup Janet Jackson. Janet has a pretty clear perspective on young black women in software engineering, by the way your gonna hear the word software
           engineering a lot so...yeah anyways Janet feels that young black women in software engineering can set off a massive effect for girls around the world because that
           sets a role model to look up to for our next generation.

          kamala Harris, For many young black women in higher education, Kamala's election as vice president of the united states is a moment of gratification and recognition
          , almost a symbol of what's been and what's to come.She has led a sense of hope for similar professions in which black women are unpresidented wheather its software 
          engineering or political. It proves what I've known all my life, the black women are AMAZING.

          Michelle Obama, first lady Michelle Obama in an interiew spoke about the importance of supporting and retaining women in the field of science, technology and 
          engineering, the so called STEM diciplines. "All hands on deck" and by that I think she means clearing hurdles for black women and girls as they navigate careers 
          in science, tech, engineering and math. Women in STEM jobs earn 33 percent more than those in non-STEM ocupations and the wage gap between men and women in STEM
          jobs is smaller than in other fields.

          LaJay York, Surprise, yup it's me! Your probably wondering why I think this topic is sooooo important. Well African American female <a onclick="softwareEngineersDialog()">software engineers</a> and developers will bring
           diversity to the team, having a different aproach to enduring or small issues. Also according to recent studies, women are way better programmers than men, but that's just my opinion
           and maybe I'm a little bias but it's totally true.
